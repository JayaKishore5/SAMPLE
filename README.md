## Controllers

### GeneralParamsController
Responsible for handling global application configurations. Manages application-wide parameters required for system operations.

### LoginController
Handles authentication and user-related actions:
- Logging in users securely.
- Registering new user accounts.

### MasterController
Manages master or static data used throughout the system:
- CRUD operations for master data entries.
- Fetch specific or all master records.

### ProcessController
Enables users to manage and track workflow processes:
- Start new workflows.
- Monitor and update process statuses.

### TestController
Provides endpoints for testing purposes:
- Validate application logic during development.
- Debug workflows and API requests.

### TransactionsController
Focuses on transactional operations:
- Create, update, and monitor transactional records.
- Ensure data consistency during multi-step operations.
